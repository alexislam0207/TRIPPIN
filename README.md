# TRIPPIN

## Project Summary
This was a final project in Northcoders created with avgrimshaw, Ak5cel, Andrew-25 and 
CamVale. We used Firebase for back-end and React Native for front-end along with other libraries.\
This is a user-friendly app for crafting personalised time capsules of holiday experiences. Users can easily document and store holidays/memories by dropping a pin on the map. The app will showcase these holidays on an interactive map, allowing users to zoom in for memories associated with the holiday. Additionally, users can generate shareable links to effortlessly showcase their holiday experiences with friends. Our goal is to offer a seamless and enjoyable way for users to relive and share their travel memories.
